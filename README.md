## Rules

- Never do or accept anything without knowing why.
  - Plugins should be installed with a reason.
  - Keybindings are only accepted if they are useful, and not just for the sake of having them.
    - Sporadically, once, if a need... Are not good excuses.
- Errors should not pass silently, thay should be annoying, loud and clear.
  - If its bothering you, fix it.
